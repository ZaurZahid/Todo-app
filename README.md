# Todo list project

## How it Works

Add items to the todo list by typing into the box and clicking to the button on the right side.\
Mark items as complete by clicking the checkmark to the left of the corresponding item.\
Delete, Edit or Cancel to edit, items by clicking the 'edit icon' to the left of the corresponding item.\
Filter items by typing letters that shows filtered data after 0.5s, on the top right side of the table.\
Change the language of the application by clicking to the button on the top right side.\
Show only checked todos by clicking to the switch on the top left side.\
Click pagination that is displayed after adding 5 todo items, to change the page.\
The application is designed to work on responsive devices.\

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn json-server`

Runs the fake JSON Server.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view Json Data in the browser.

JSON Server helps us to set up a REST API simply and quickly.\

### `yarn start-together`

Runs the app and the fake JSON Server in the development mode concurrently.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view Json Data in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
